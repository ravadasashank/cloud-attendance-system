## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- PostgreSQL (v12 or higher)
- AWS Account
- Terraform (v1.0 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cloud-attendance-system.git
   cd cloud-attendance-system
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. Configure environment variables:
   Create `.env` files in both backend and frontend directories (see `.env.example` files)

5. Set up infrastructure:
   ```bash
   cd infra
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`

## Deployment

### Production Build

1. Build the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy using Terraform:
   ```bash
   cd infra
   terraform apply
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Database connection errors
- Verify database credentials in `.env` file
- Ensure port 3001 is not already in use

#### Frontend can't connect to backend
- Verify `REACT_APP_API_URL` in frontend `.env` file
- Check that backend is running and accessible
- Review CORS settings in backend server

#### Terraform apply fails
- Verify AWS credentials are configured correctly
- Check that you have necessary AWS permissions
- Review Terraform error messages for specific resource issues
